        <p>Improving the digital experience</p>

          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>Throughout my career, I have designed desktop and mobile interfaces, built interactive components, and led teams to redesign the end-to-end user experience. I have performed almost every role on the user experience spectrum having worked on all types of digital projects, I bring the added benefit of translating my designs to front-end development, including: advanced HTML5, CSS and Sass with just enough JavaScript experience to be dangerous, but always able get my point across.</p>
          <p>Currently, I work at <a href="https://www.gallup.com/home.aspx" title="Analytics and Advice">Gallup</a> based in Omaha, Nebraska and take on freelance jobs through <a href="https://www.upwork.com/" title="Freelance Marketplace">UpWork</a>. I began with a background in graphic and interaction design, transitioned into web design and technology, and eventually landed in the realm of UX development. My goal is driving the daily execution of UX and my mission is discovering how businesses need to improve, setting  vision and strategies, and creating the right processes to balance business requirements with user needs.</p>
          <p>I have studied user behavior extensively in A/B or multi-variate testing where hypotheses are created based on this data. I look at best practices and industry standards, but often find better results are achieved with data-driven solutions. Some of the methods I have employed are interviews, surveys, and field study observations.</p>
          <p>Since my latest role was lead for an internal proprietary content management system, I had one-on-one conversations with our target audience (developers, editors, copywriters, project managers and administrators). Early on, I sent out an email with focused questions to understand any problem areas they were experiencing. I also published a post-release newsletter with a link to a feedback form a few days after implementation.</p>
          <p>During 2006, while employed at <a href="https://www.hayneedle.com/">Hayneedle</a>, the UX team followed a 4-step process: product discovery, ideation, prototyping, and interaction testing. This strategy was used in 2012 to collaborate with a team to iterate <a href="https://www.orientaltrading.com/">Oriental Trading</a> company's <a href="https://www.orientaltrading.com/50th-anniversary-party-photo-custom-banner-medium-a2-13611281.fltr?categoryId=551269+1248+18">personalized product initiative</a> with continuous improvements. I have continued through the years utilizing Lean UX, Design Thinking, and User-Centered Design processes.</p>
          <p>At the end of the day, I prefer exhibiting empathy and humility and love working with good people who care about customers and each member of the team.</p>

          <h4>My approach to creative thinking</h4>
          <ul className="alt">
                <li>Competitive analysis and audits of competitor and client sites, as well as sites that exhibit innovative methods to determine opportunities for improvement.</li>
                <li>Design research &amp; discovery with target users to understand their mental models and behaviors, unmet needs and goals, and emotional connections.</li>
                <li>Recommend tactics and features that will best serve the user, the business, and technology.</li>
                <li>Conceptualize ideal user interaction paths/task flows/scenarios, etc. based on research data.</li>
                <li>Lead the multi-disciplinary team through mockups, low and high-fidelity prototyping, to promote design thinking and establish intuitive interaction design patterns.</li>
                <li>Celebrate, debate, build, and respect the team.</li>
              </ul>

          <p>
            With a tendency to rely on science and data, or critical thinking, this paves the way to making informed UX decisions - what to ask for, when to use it, and how to question it. There is nothing quite like the feeling I get from taking something complex and making it easy to use and helping everybody achieve their goals.

            <h4>My Top Five Strengths</h4>
            <p>Maximizer, Futuristic, Self-Assurance, Ideation, Relator</p>
          </header>
          <p>This distinct CliftonStrengths profile presents my five most dominant themes out of the 34 measured and is a way to identify my talent DNA. Extensive research conducted by the Gallup organization suggest that the most effective people are those who understand their strengths and behaviors. You are then best able to develop strategies to meet and exceed the demands of your daily life, your career, and your family.</p>
          <p> With this knowledge, you not only gain a basic sense of your abilites, but an awareness and understanding of your natural talents that will provide true insight into the core reasons behind your consistent successes.</p>
          <p>There is a secondary framework that outlines four CliftonStrengths domains&#8212;<span className="cs-executing">Executing</span>, <span className="cs-influence">Influencing</span>, <span className="cs-relationship">Relationship Building</span>, and <span className="cs-strategic">Strategic Thinking</span>&#8212;and is another way to think about strengths and how one contributes when you join, create, or lead a team. I have found that working in my various roles within Gallup, this awareness empowers the teams to be more cohesive, versatile, productive, and engaged.</p>
          <p className="mb-0"><span className="cs-influence">Influencing theme</span> - I tend to lead with influencing and the following strengths help me take charge, speak up, and make sure others are heard:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Maximizer.</strong> This is without a doubt what drives me in all aspects of my life in that I love to help others become excited about their potential, and have the ability to see how people's talents match the tasks that must be completed. Excellence, not average, is my measure and pursuit.</li>
              <li><strong>Self-Assurance.</strong> Lead the way, knowing it's okay to ask for directions. I trust my talents, but always gather enough input from others to ensure well-informed decisions are made. I tend to take chances when most of my teammates are reluctant to do so, and challenge them to try something new, different or difficult.</li>
            </ul>
          <p className="mb-0"><span className="cs-strategic">Strategic Thinking theme</span> helps me absorb and analyze information that informs better decisions. Accompanying strengths include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Futuristic.</strong> The future fascinates me. A better everything is inspirational and energizing.</li>
              <li><strong>Ideation.</strong> I have sketchbooks everywhere to get ideas or concepts out of my head to make room for more, whether it's a bike rack for the truck bed or capturing my thoughts after having an aha moment to a particularly difficult issue. It's very satisfying when a complex surface problem becomes an elegant and simplistic story.</li>
            </ul>
          <p className="mb-0"><span className="cs-relationship">Relationship Building theme</span> guides me to build strong relationships that hold a team together:</p>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Relator.</strong> I am often pleasantly surprised by who seeks me out looking for guidance. As far as my team goes, they know I will give them an honest perspective about a project, person, event, or idea.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The getaway</h4>
            <p>An adventurous 3600+ mile round trip</p>
          </header>
          <p>Every year for the past four years we have made a road trip to Washington state to visit my daughter and her family, not taking the same route twice. We have hiked and biked trails along the Columbia River, on Mt. Rainier, Mt. Evans, Oregon beaches, Multnomah Falls, Gallatin Gateway, Yellowstone, Devil's Tower and various other scenic points along the way. We've seen black bear, elk, bison, eagles, antelope, marmots, mule deer, mountain goats and bighorn sheep. We've driven past a tornado in Colorado, witnessed the eclipse on the way to Mt. Rainier, had to turn around in a Wyoming snowstorm, drove a hundred miles in Utah mountain fog, drove through thick smoke and saw distant forest fires in Montana and&#8230;the adventure continues.</p>
          <p>If you've made it this far, a fun fact about me&#8212;prior to my career as a UX professional, I worked with difficult and problem horses in Mariposa-Madera counties of California, and the foothills of Mt. Rainier. </p>
